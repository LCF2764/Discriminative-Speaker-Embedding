NIST is making available these matlab files to be used to produce
Detection Error Trade-off curves with the matlab software package.

For a basic test of these matlab scripts, start matlab and type the
command: "Eval_Spkr_Det"

This script reads the files:
  A) true_speaker_scores
  B) impostor_scores

  and produces a sample DET curve.

By making the appropriate changes to the files true_speaker_scores and
impostor_scores, you can produce your own DET-curves with:
"Eval_Spkr_Det"

Run "DET_usage" for a more detailed demonstration of the capabilities
of these scripts.
